Technical report from Intelligent Internet (2026) on how an agent harness should control work that may run for days or weeks, where the dominant failure mode is *premature completion* rather than inability to make progress.

## Abstract

Long-running agents often fail not because they cannot make progress, but because they stop before the task is truly complete. We tested five harness designs across eight long-horizon tasks to isolate the control mechanisms that matter: repeated gap-finding, revisable planning, independent verification, adaptive orchestration, and stopping discipline.

RALPH is the strongest simple baseline because it forces each new session to reopen the gap between the current project state and the original requirement. But RALPH is expensive and has no principled stopping rule.

Our Zenith method keeps the useful parts of repeated review while making the loop adaptive: the orchestrator dynamically allocates workers, testers, reusable skills, replanning, and stopping decisions. In this study, Zenith achieved the best mean rank while using less than half of RALPH's per-task cost.

## Installation

Zenith is a small MCP/ACP harness that runs a coding agent as a multi-agent orchestrator. See [`zenith/`](zenith/) for the full package.

**Requirements**

- Python 3.11+
- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- Claude Code or Codex

**Install**

```bash
cd zenith
uv sync
uv run zenith --help
```

**Initialize a workspace**

```bash
# Claude Code
uv run zenith init --agent claude

# Or Codex
uv run zenith init --agent codex
```

**Run a mission**

Start your agent from the initialized workspace:

```bash
claude
# or
codex
```

Then ask the agent to read the generated orchestrator prompt:

```text
Read .claude/orchestrator_prompt.md and use Zenith to run this mission.

<your instruction or query>
```

For Codex, point it at `.codex/orchestrator_prompt.md` instead.

## Zenith

A single orchestrator session reads task state each turn and decides what to do next: spawn worker or tester subagents, register a reusable skill, replan, or stop. Workers and testers run in their own contexts and report back; the orchestrator integrates their results before the next decision.

## Results

### Frontier SWE Benchmark

On the Frontier SWE benchmark, Zenith — running on GPT-5.5 — ranks first overall, leading on implementation, performance, and dominance against frontier models paired with their native harnesses.

### Ablation Study

To isolate the control mechanisms that matter, we compared Zenith against RALPH and three reduced harness variants across eight long-horizon tasks. Zenith achieves the best mean rank at less than half of RALPH's per-task cost.

| Method | Mean rank ↓ | Mean cost (USD/task) ↓ | Wins (of 8) ↑ |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| One-session | 5.00 | $22.21 | 0 |
| Plan-RALPH | 4.00 | $161.53 | 0 |
| Milestone-RALPH | 2.88 | $209.47 | 0 |
| RALPH | 1.75 | $407.58 | 3 |
| **Zenith** | **1.38** | **$175.68** | **5** |

<sub>*A "win" is a task on which the method ranked first; the eight wins partition the eight benchmark tasks.*</sub>
